# Hex-to-MIPS-Assembler-Converter
takes 8-digit length hexadecimal values and converts the value to a MIPS assembler instruction.

MIPS instruction set based off this online document from eclass.teicrete.gr:
https://eclass.teicrete.gr/modules/document/file.php/TP286/%CE%92%CE%BF%CE%B7%CE%B8%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC%20%CE%B5%CE%B3%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1/MIPS_Instruction_Coding_With_Hex.pdf

In its current state, the project is considered a rough draft or proof of concept. 

There are a few things I wish to improve in the future, which can be seen under Projects.
